<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[7] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted
   programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly
   typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
</p><p>
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide
Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web
applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[9] and all major web browsers have a
dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
